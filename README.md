# A Geometrically Driven Swarm Algorithm Enhanced with Obstacle Avoidance
A joint Research Project about swarms coordination algorithm that can models deformable body movement in 2D \& also avoiding obstacles while moving towards a target
        
1) Lagrangian Modeling of the Swarm
2) Developing an Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm 
3) Studying the Poisson effect on stability of the swarm
4) Autonomous Trajectory Planing in a Field of Static Obstacles 
5) Coding & Simulation using Wolfram Mathematica
